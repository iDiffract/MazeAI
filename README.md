# MazeAI
A* Search Algorithm Maze - the application uses Pygame for graphical representation of the maze, the start and target points, and the path found.

## Features
Maze UI: 

The application provides a graphical user interface that displays the maze. The maze is randomly generated each time the program runs.

A* Pathfinding: 

The application uses the A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from the start point to the target point. This path is highlighted in green.

Pygame Interface: 

The application uses Pygame, a set of Python modules designed for writing video games, for its graphical user interface.

## Usage

To run the application:
1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. This includes Python and Pygame.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the cloned directory via the terminal.

4. Run python main.py.
   
When the application is running, you'll see the maze displayed in a new window. The start point, target point, and the shortest path between them (calculated using the A* search algorithm) are highlighted.
